As per Rob:
    - Need to implement time stamps
    - Profile page per user?

Instructions on Classes:

"The second stage will involve splitting off the back end off to a separate server machine, implemented in C++ and communication done via TCP/IP."

-----

"Now that you have this great web application, we want to move the data and application logic off of our webserver. All data will be maintained on a remote application server, implemented in C++ on a unix host. The web server and the application data server will communicate through TCP/IP."

-----

Provide clear documentation describing:

- the messages that will be sent between the web server and the application data server.
- the structure of the files that the application data server will use. Note, these are not databases.
- any modifications to the user interface.

Working in a new folder, since it's likely that we'll be using a completely different directory organization.

Right Now:

- Socket connection can be made
- Can read HTTP requests from the client
- Can break up HTTP requests into pieces
- Can serve HTML and CSS files

- Cannot serve images (need to be able to serve large file sizes)
- Cannot deal with sessions / cookies -- need to make use of HTTP cookie-setting
- Cannot deal with POST requests
- Need to deal with templated sections on HTML pages
	- A matter of parsing files and checking flags
