# Running the Application

Compile `server.cpp` and create the output executable.

As an example, you can accomplish this by running the following command in terminal if you have the g++ compiler installed:

`g++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o server`

Afterwards, run the actual server executable:

`./server`

You must then access the web server as a client by opening a browser of your choice and pointing it at the following address:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000`
