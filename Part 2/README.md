# Running the Application

Compile `server.cpp` and create the output executable, such as by running the following line in a command line environment on a *nix machine:

`g++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o server`

Then run the actual server executable:

`./server`

You must then access the web server as a client by opening a browser of your choice and pointing it at the following address:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000`
