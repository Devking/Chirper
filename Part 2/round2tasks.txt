Instructions on Classes:

"The second stage will involve splitting off the back end off to a separate server machine, implemented in C++ and communication done via TCP/IP."

-----

"Now that you have this great web application, we want to move the data and application logic off of our webserver. All data will be maintained on a remote application server, implemented in C++ on a unix host. The web server and the application data server will communicate through TCP/IP."

-----

Provide clear documentation describing:

- the messages that will be sent between the web server and the application data server.
- the structure of the files that the application data server will use. Note, these are not databases.
- any modifications to the user interface.
