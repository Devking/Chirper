1. remove manifest from python
2. set up client connection using python
3. serve user information using cpp
4. write API for client-server calls

------

1 file for list of users
1 file for each user
1 file for list of emails

------

we do a file read on *every* request, because
we do not want to store all of the user data
in memory and potentially cause a stack overflow!

------

client opens a connection for every request (not persistent)
we look through the file each time based on what the client requests

non-encryption

------

potential queries:

- check email 				CHECKEMAIL test@email.com
- check username
- delete user
- create user
- create chirp 				CREATE username\nchirp
- delete chirp 				DELETE username\nchirpid
- delete friend   			DELETE username\nfriend
- add friend 				ADD username\nfriend
- populate  				POPULATE username

later:
- reorder friends

first field: action
space
second field: username/email
newline
optional data field: friend name, chirp content, chirp id, whatnot

------

email file: csv of emails
	- emails only separated by commas, no spaces
	- need comma after last email as well!
