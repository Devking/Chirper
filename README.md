# Chirper

The not-very-original social media alternative, designed by Wells Lucas Santo and Patrick Kingchatchaval.

## Dependencies

This application runs on Python 2.7.11 and requires the Flask package.

This application also has a minor feature that uses jQuery. We are using jQuery from Google's hosted library service, so this feature will only work if you are connected to the internet.

## Running the Application

On this directory, run the following in the terminal:

`python main.py`

This will start a Flask-based server, running on localhost.

You can access the web application at the following address:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000`

This server will persist the session (aka retain all newly created users and messages) until you stop the server.
