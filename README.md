# Chirper

The not-very-original social media alternative, designed by **Wells Lucas Santo** and **Patrick Kingchatchaval**.

## Dependencies

This application runs on **Python 2.7.11** and requires the **Flask** package.

This application also has a minor feature that uses **jQuery**.

We are using jQuery from Google's hosted library service, so this feature will only work if you are connected to the internet.

This application has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, on Ubuntu, Mac OSX, and Windows.

This application also incorporates *responsive design* â€” if you run the server on your public IP, you can access the application on a mobile device to see a mobile version of the site. 

## Running the Application

On this directory, run the following in the terminal:

`python main.py`

This will start a Flask-based server, running on localhost.

You can access the web application at the following address:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000`

This server will persist the session (aka retain all newly created users and messages) until you stop the server.

## Dummy Example Data

Right now, since we are storing user data in memory, we already have three users in the system as dummy example data.

These three users are as follows:

> **Username:** admin
>
> **Password:** pass

and

> **Username:** bob
>
> **Password:** dole

and

> **Username:** tai
>
> **Password:** lopez

admin is following both bob and tai, and can be used to best illustrate the functionality of the application.
