# Chirper

The not-very-original social media alternative, designed by Wells Lucas Santo and Patrick Kingchatchaval.

## Dependencies

This application runs on Python 2.7.11 and requires the Flask package.

## Running the Application

On this directory, run the following:

`python main.py`

This will start a Flask-based server, running on localhost.

This server will persist the session (aka retain all newly created users and messages) until you stop the server.
