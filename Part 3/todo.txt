Rob's Comments For Part 2:

- little to no documentation/comments in your C++ code, try to comment more to explain appropriate chunks of code

- overall pretty good use of functions, but just a few that are around 100 lines each. try to to keep functions down to around 30-50 lines

- otherwise, good use of separate compilation. covered thorough set of edge cases, well documented README/api/explanation of message passing. keep up the work for future stages and try avoid being late not penalized for these:

- include some sort of timestamps for messages
- "friends" on social media tends to imply bidirectional relationship, you might want to rename your friends list to "following list"
- consider having a way to see who you're being followed by

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To Do Before Part 3:

refactor query functions
add comments
add timestamps
see followers

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- deal with locks of files
- provide documentation of "What shared data is being accessed by multiple threads and what you are doing to address potential race conditions."
